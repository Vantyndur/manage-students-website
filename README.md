# manage-students-website
I've created a website to manage students, their subjects and their grades.
The website uses IndexedDB database to store data in 3 tables, which are Students, Subjects and Grades.
User can:
- add students
- add subjects
- add subject to student
- give a grade for a student
- delete students
- delete grades
- delete subjects
I've made the website responsive using flexbox. 
The look of tables is made using bootstrap classes.
I hope you'll find my project interesting.
