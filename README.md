# manage-students-website
I've created a website to manage students, their subjects and their grades.
The website uses IndexedDB database to store data in 3 tables, which are Students, Subjects and Grades.
User can:
- add students
- add subjects
- add subject to student
- give a grade for a student
- delete students
- delete grades
- delete subjects
I've made the website responsive using flexbox. 
The look of tables is made using bootstrap classes.

I've added some pictures of website for a quick look. 
You can find them in directory named 'images'.
If you want to try using my website, download directory named 'site'.
When your download is complete you can open file named 'index.html' in your browser. I suggest firefox, which was used for tests.

I hope you'll find my project interesting.
